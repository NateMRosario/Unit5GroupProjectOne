//Message by Melissa: This will be the custom view that will go into the collections tab! maybe this view can also be reused or another view could be in the add/create collection view?

class CollectionView: UIView {
 
    //to do
        //set up custom view
        //set up collection view in the lazy var - maybe the padding?
        //set up constraints
