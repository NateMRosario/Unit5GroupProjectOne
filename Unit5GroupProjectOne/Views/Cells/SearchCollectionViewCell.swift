//Message by Melissa: this will be for the collection view that is seen in the search tab

class SearchCollectionViewCell: UICollectionViewCell {
    
    //to do
        //set up initializers (so that you can register them to collection views)
        //set up collection view properties and constraints
        //maybe add a "configure cell" function here that takes in some parameter and sets up the property for you, instead of having to do all that in the cellForItemAt datasource method in the view controller (to avoid cluttering the view controller, and having a cell that is more reusable)
