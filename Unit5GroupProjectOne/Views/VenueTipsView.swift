//Message by Melissa: this is the view that the users will see after tapping the "+" bar button item in the venue detail view to add the venue to their collections or create a new collection with that venue
    //could also be what they see if they're in the collections tab; in the venue detail view, instead of seeing the "+" sign, they should see the "edit" sign so they can edit their tips!

class VenueTipsView: UIView {
    
    //to do:
        //should have a collection view at the bottom, and some stuff at the top
        //should have a textfield at the top which takes in the collection name
        //should have a "leave a tip" label
        //and below it should be a text view that lets you write/edit tips
        //create properties and initializers
    
        //maybe name the collection view the bottom view?
