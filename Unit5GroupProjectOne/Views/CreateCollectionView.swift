//Message by Melissa: This is the view you see when the user in the collections tab and decides to create a new collection that doesn't have any venues in it yet

class CreateCollectionView: UIView {
    
    //to do:
        //should probably just have a textfield at the top that can take in a name!
        //textfield should check for existing collection names and maybe not allow it if it works
